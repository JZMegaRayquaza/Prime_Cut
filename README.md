# Prime Cut Assistant

This project helps automate the process of achieving perfect Prime Cut scores in Mario Party using computer vision and an Elgato capture card.

## Installing Required Libraries

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Reproduction Instructions

### Step 1: Process Steak Images

Make sure the `steaks/` folder is in the same directory as `process.py`.

Run:

```bash
python process.py
```

This generates:
- `steak_crops/` – cropped steak images
- `steak_blurs/` – blurred versions for preprocessing
- `steak_edges/` – edge-detected versions of the crops

### Step 2: Clean Up Edges

Use an image editing tool (e.g., Apple Photos) to clean up `steak_edges/` by removing unwanted contours.

Save the cleaned images into:

```
steak_edges_cleaned/
```

### Step 3: Determine Cut Locations

Make sure `steak_edges_cleaned/` is in the same directory as `cuts.py`.

Run:

```bash
python cuts.py
```

This generates:
- `steak_masks/` – binary masks for each cut
- `steak_approx_cuts.json` – automatically estimated cut lines

### Step 4: Refine Cut Accuracy

Play Prime Cut on the Nintendo Switch and use the live guidance from `prime_cut.py` to evaluate and manually refine the cuts.

Save your corrected data into:

```
steak_half_cuts.json
```

### Step 5: Achieve Perfect Prime Cut Scores

Make sure `steak_crops/` and `steak_half_cuts.json` are in the same directory as `prime_cut.py`.

Run:

```bash
python prime_cut.py
```

Red guide lines will be overlaid on the steak during live gameplay to help you align the slicer precisely for perfect 50/50 scores.
